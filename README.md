# Welcome to the official repository for Codeblock Visual Studio! #

What is Codeblock Visual Studio? The final goal is to create a simple,
block-based IDE that can code in powerful languages such as Python instead
of a "lite" language.

In addition to being helpful for beginners to coding, we aim to create a visual debugging experience for even moderate-advanced users. Currently, our application handles color-coding, run-time checks, and a powerful linter backed by flake8.

When you are developing, open a new Issue (see left) describing what you are doing
and create a branch for that issue. Open a pull request when you are finished.

DO NOT EDIT THE MASTER BRANCH UNLESS EXPLICITLY GIVEN PERMISSION.
DO NOT PUSH CHANGES TO DEVELOP UNTIL STABLE.
